# Marvin, the paranoid bot (Î² stage)

Marvin is an attempt to combine the ease of use of [hubot](https://hubot.github.com) with the typesafety and easy syntax of Haskell and the performance gains from compiled languages.

## Installing and using marvin

The verbose documentation can be found on readthedocs https://marvin.readthedocs.io.
It should hopefully answer all your questions.

Installation instructions are on [this](http://marvin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html) documentation page.

## A teaser

```Haskell
module MyScript where

import Marvin.Prelude

script :: (IsAdapter a, SupportsFiles a) => ScriptInit a
script = defineScript "my-script" $ do
    hear "sudo (.+)" $ do
        match <- getMatch

        reply $(isL "All right, i'll do #{match !! 1}")
    
    respond "repeat" $ do
        message <- getMessage

        send $(isL "You wrote #{message}")
    
    respond "what is in file ([\\w\\._/-]+)\\??" $ do
        match <- getMatch 
        let file = match !! 1

        contents <- liftIO $ readFile file

        send contents
    
    respond "upload file ([\\w\\._/-]+)" $ do
        [_, filepath] <- getMatch
        chan <- getChannel
        f <- sendFile filepath
        case res of
            Left err -> send $(isL "Failed to share file: #{err}")
            Right _  -> send "File successfully uploaded"
    
    enterIn "random" $ do
        user <- getUser
        send $(isL "Hello #{user^.username} welcome to the random channel!")
    
    fileSharedIn "announcements" $ do
        file <- getFile
        safeFileToDir file "shared-files"
```

## Status of the project

I currently do not actively develop this project. I am happy to merge pull requests but I will likely not have time to work on issues myself. It is also likely that the adapters are not up-to-date with the APIs they are supposed to interact with so be aware. 

**Maintenance Level**: Happy to merge

**Accepting maintainers**: Yes

For information on the meaning of this see [commercialhaskell guide to OSS maintenance](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/commercialhaskell/blob/master/guide/open-source-maintenance.md) 

### Issues and errors

If you are a marvin user, please report any error, issues, or improvement suggestions to the [issue section](https://github.com/JustusAdam/marvin/issues) or [write me an email](mailto:dev@justus.science).

### Testing

I welcome anybody who tests marvin by deploying it. 
Especially testing different adapters is a huge help.

### Hacking

If you want to hack on marvin, feel free to do so and send me your changes as pull requests.

Current hot places to get started:

- Convenient HTTP requests API in `Marvin.Util.HTTP`.
- Convenient JSON handling API in `Marvin.Util.JSON`.
- New adapters as submodules of `Marvin.Adapter`.
- A basic library of scripts (maybe as a `Marvin.Scripts.Prelude` module?) (inspiration: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts)
